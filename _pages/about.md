Welcome! I am a postdoctoral fellow in the lab of [Rajiv McCoy](https://mccoy-lab.org) at Johns Hopkins University. I received my Ph.D. from the [Cell, Molecular, Developmental Biology & Biophysics Program](https://cmdb.jhu.edu) at Johns Hopkins University, where I was co-advised by [John Kim](https://sites.krieger.jhu.edu/kimlab/) in the Department of Biology and [Mike Schatz](https://schatz-lab.org) in the Department of Computer Science.
